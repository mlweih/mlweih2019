						<p class="special">You're an expert in your field. You have complex, and sought-after insights. Yet every time a yearly strategy meeting comes up, do you feel foolish in front of the Digital team, who waxes on about marketing strategies that barely resonate? You know that <strong>digital tactics are the way of the future.</strong> You also know it's not going away. You know which competitors actually get all the "social" stuff (and can see how it leverages their results), if only someone would just explain the damn thing then you'd put it into your 5-year-plan as well. Not to mention how great it'd be to hear "I really apprecated reading your perspective last week on LinkedIn. That hadn't occured to me," at the next Board meeting. </p>
						<h3 class="special">
						<em>I hear you.</em>
					</h3>
						<p class="special">There's a good reason you feel frustrated and confused - there are virtually no trainings around how to know where to start with the internet, aside from your kid's advice of "maybe have a YouTube?" In-house webinars are dull and barely scratch the surface, and they certainly don't cover how to <strong>make the Internet work for your career</strong> in a way that's helpful and stress-free. It's the corporate equivalent of throwing a book down in front of a toddler and expecting the child to read.</p>

								<h2>How does a Personal Digital Strategy Work?</h2>
							</header>
							<p class="special">
								A Social Media presence is a powerful and flexible tool, and to make the most of it, you need a strategy. The clients I work with are interested in the digital world, but are <strong>unclear about how to present themselves online</strong> in a way that feels natural to them and doesn't take over their personality. <br />
								Together, we remove that knowledge gap.
							</p>
							<div class="special">
							<h3 class="special"><em>At its heart, a Personal Digital Strategy consists of 3 parts:</em></h3>
							<h3 class="special">An in-depth look into your life and goals</h3>
							<div class="box">
								<p>Strategies aren't one-size-fits-all, so it's critical to first understand who you are and what you're about. We're taking a look into your <strong>personality, lifestyle, how you communicate,</strong> and which of your <strong>life + career goals</strong> your social media presence will influence.</p>
								<p>
									This will be done over the course of a couple one-on-one Discovery calls, and a few worksheets. All of that data will highlight insights that drive a <strong>successful social media profile,</strong> based on your specific niche and expertise.</p>
							</div>
							<h3 class="special">A Custom Strategy</h3>
							<div class="box">
								<p>Based on our Discovery calls, I'll put together a Strategy package specifically built for you. This is an analysis of all the specifics covered in our Discovery calls, woven in with my expertise. This package will cover:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Your Personal Communication Style, and how to craft content in a way that fits your life</li>
									<li>Overview of your Target Audience, including where they are online and how to reach them</li>
									<li>Your major content pillars, so there's never any guess work on what to post next</li>
									<li>Recommendations for which of the "Big Four" social media channels will be your Home Base.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									We'll walk through this package in another call, and go over exactly how this will serve as your foundation for getting online successfully.
								</p>
							</div>
							<h3 class="special">Implementation Plan</h3>
							<div class="box">
								<p>Now to put it into action. Taking into consideration your personal habit-building styles, the implementation plan will consist of three phases.</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Core Channel Work</li>
									<li>Content Voice Development</li>
									<li>Audience Engagement</li>
								</ol>
								<p>
									All of this is done through regular emails and one-on-one sessions. In addition to your specific channel development, I'll also be teaching you everything I know about the <strong>structures social media is built upon,</strong> digital communication tactics, community building, and <strong>online + offline lifestyle alignment.</strong> When it's all done, you're ready to go!

						<h2>Still not sure if I can help you?</h2>
							<p>If you're concerned about getting started with Instagram because it means you have to slog away at a stream of inane food pics, or it seems that the only way forward online is to become a wailing political Twitter banshee, no worries! I'll only make those recommendations if it fits your communication style.
							</p>
							<p>Think of it this way: in all other aspects of your life, you probably have a plan to keep track of what's going on. Why not create one for getting yourself online? Just look at any news outlet to see people fooling around online who had no real understanding of what they were tackling. It's not that they're dumb, it's that they got caught up in a system they've never been taught.
							</p>
							<p>I'm committed to helping you feel <strong>secure and empowered</strong> by having an online presence, by learning how to navigate the systems they're built upon. To me social media is a knowledge-sharing tool; essentially the world's most advanced textbook. When you understand the "language" it's written in, you can not only use it any way that feels right for you, but also write your own chapters.
