You know which competitors actually get all the "social" stuff (and can see how it leverages their networks), if only someone would just explain the damn thing then you'd put it into your 5-year-plan as well. Not to mention how great it'd be to hear "I really apprecated reading your perspective last week on LinkedIn. That hadn't occured to me," from a respected colleague. </p>

There's certainly no how-to manual for how to appear online as an expert, the way you do face-to-face with your clients. It's the corporate equivalent of throwing a book down in front of a toddler and expecting the child to read.</p>

												Not exactly, but I understand that mindset. There's a lot going on with the Internet right now, particularly regarding privacy, ethics, community building, and safety. It's a pretty overwhelming time to get started on your own, and it can feel like the whole thing is a minefield.</p>
											<p class="special">
												Social Media isn't solely a hangout for Millennials and Gen-Z to send vague photos of stock image eggs. It's the world's next economy plus communication powerhouse. The world's top CEO's, Presidents, and Directors all understand how a digital presence is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2019/02/12/why-personal-branding-is-more-important-than-ever/#4f052cc24085">more important now than ever.</a>

								<h2>How does a Personal Digital Strategy Work?</h2>
							</header>
							<p class="special">
								A Social Media presence is a powerful and flexible tool, and to make the most of it, you need a strategy. The clients I work with are interested in the digital world, but are <strong>unclear about how to present themselves online</strong> in a way that feels natural to them, connects to the people they want to talk to, and doesn't take over their personality or "free time". <br />
								Together, we remove that knowledge gap.
							</p>
							<div class="special">
							<h3 class="special"><em>At its heart, a Personal Digital Strategy consists of 3 parts:</em></h3>
							<h3 class="special">An in-depth look into your life and goals</h3>
							<div class="box">
								<p>Strategies aren't one-size-fits-all, so it's critical to first understand who you are and what you're about. We're taking a look into your <strong>personality, lifestyle, how you communicate,</strong> and which of your <strong>life + career goals</strong> your social media presence will influence.</p>
								<p>
									You already know Discovery is the basis of sustainable, profitable growth. For us, Discovery will be a few phone calls and worksheets. From these insights, we'll craft a social media foundation based on your <strong>expertise and aspirations.</strong></p>
							</div>
							<h3 class="special">A Custom Strategy</h3>
							<div class="box">
								<p> Based on our Discovery calls, I'll put together a Strategy package specifically built for you. This is an analysis of all the specifics covered in our Discovery calls, woven in with my expertise. This package will cover:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Your <strong>Personal Communication Style</strong>, and how to craft content in a way that fits your life.</li>
									<li>Overview of your Target Audience, including <strong>where they are online and how to reach them</strong>.</li>
									<li>Your major content pillars, so there's <strong>never any guessing</strong> or fluff on what to post next.</li>
									<li>Recommendations for which of the <strong>"Big Four" social media channels</strong> will be your Home Base.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									We'll walk through this package in another call, and go over exactly how this will serve as your road map for getting online successfully.
								</p>
							</div>
							<h3 class="special">Implementation Plan</h3>
							<div class="box">
								<p>Now to put it into action. Taking into consideration your personal habit-building styles, the implementation plan will consist of three phases.</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Core Channel Work</li>
									<li>Content Voice Development</li>
									<li>Audience Engagement</li>
								</ol>
								<p>
									All of this is done through regular emails and one-on-one sessions. In addition to your specific channel development, I'll also be teaching you what <strong>you need to know</strong> about the structures social media is built upon, <strong>digital communication tactics</strong>, community building, and <strong>online + offline lifestyle alignment.</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									After a few months, you will have created an impactful social media presence, you'll be comfortable running it in a way that works for your life, and most importantly you'll be <strong>translating your expertise</strong> into interesting and insightful content as a community thought leader.

						<h2>Still not sure if I can help you?</h2>
							<p>If you're concerned about getting started with Instagram because it means you have to slog away at a stream of inane food pics, or it seems that the only way forward online is to become a wailing political Twitter banshee, no worries! I'll only make those recommendations if it fits your communication style.
							</p>
							<p>Think of it this way: in all other aspects of your life, you probably have a plan to keep track of what's going on. Why not create one for getting yourself online? Not just that, you know your clients are googling you, and expect to see a credible person. If you're not "there" in their search, or even worse your LinkedIn profile is 5 years old (and showing your practice in a whole different State), that's an authenticity gap.
							</p>
							<p>I'm committed to helping you feel <strong>secure and empowered</strong> by having an online presence, by learning how to navigate the systems they're built upon. To me social media is a knowledge-sharing tool; essentially the world's most advanced textbook. When you understand the "language" it's written in, you can not only use it any way that feels right for you, but also write your own chapters.
